The purpose of this project is not only to showcase knowledge in C++, but also to
demonstrate continued understanding and research of computer science concepts. This will be done using code demonstrations,
blogs, graphs to demonstrate the live speed of backend algorithms, the creation and documentation of backend tools, etc.

This is for a webapp in C++ and React
* Create db user model
* Users will be able to authenticate
* Certain pages will have permissions
* Publish a blog that shows a graph of the performance of an algorithm
* Publish a blog that compares the performance of two algorithms
* Make it dynamic based on input
